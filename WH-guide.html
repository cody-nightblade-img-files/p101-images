      <h1 class="wh" id="intro">Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Recently, I've been wondering if there were any known specific details about Witch Hunter.
        <br />
        Search results weren't helpful, so I decided to investigate with the help of one of my friends, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ultzx">ultzx</a>.
        <br />
        After about one month, we figured out how exactly it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information can be helpful to others, so I have created this guide.
        <br />
        I will discuss how Witch Hunter works, including examples to help with understanding.
      </p>

      <h1 class="wh" id="basic">What is Witch Hunter?</h1>
      <p>
        In case you are not familiar, Witch Hunter allows the user to make a bonus attack if the enemy uses magic on them.
        <br/>This attack occurs before the magic attack that activated it.
        <br/>It also activates before Intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also states that it reduces damage taken by 50% for the incoming magical attack that activated it.
        <br/>(The in-game text states "-50% <i>Weapon Power</i> vs Magic." It does not actually reduce Weapon Power, just damage taken.)

        How do you train Witch Hunter?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Certain companions can train Witch Hunter.
        <br/>(most Witchdoctor companions + some Privateer Companions, like Wing Chun and Lucky Jack Russel)
        <br />
        Pirates can obtain up to 3 ranks of Witch Hunter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ways to get Witch Hunter ranks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          trained from Kurotadori (the Witchdoctor Clandestine Trainer) for 1 Practice Point.
          <br/>(required: Level 20+, Staffy Weapons 2)
        </li>
        <li>
          granted by Phule's Wand (dropped in the Bruno Chapel instance)
        </li>
        <li>
          granted by a pet with the Grants Witch Hunter pet talent
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="wh" id="atk">
        What kind of attack does Witch Hunter deal?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The bonus attack from Witch Hunter actually depends on the user's basic attack type -- melee, ranged, or magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user with Witch Hunter is a....
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          melee unit -- Witch Hunter deals a melee attack
        </li>
        <li>
          ranged unit -- Witch Hunter deals a ranged attack
        </li>
        <li>
          magic unit -- Witch Hunter deals a magic attack
          <br/>(If the enemy has Witch Hunter, then this may cause their Witch Hunter to activate, causing a Witch Hunter chain.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <center><img src="images/text divider.png"/></center>

      <h1 class="wh" id="activate">
        How exactly does Witch Hunter activate?
      </h1>
      <p>
        The game states that Witch Hunter activates against incoming enemy magic.
        <br/>However, the bonus attack and damage reduction only occur under certain conditions, meaning that it's possible for Witch Hunter to do <b>absolutely nothing</b> when attacked with magic.
      </p>

      <h2 class="wh">
        Witch Hunter's Damage Reduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Witch Hunter's damage reduction requires being next to the unit attacking you with magic.
        <br/>In this regard, it favors melee units, since they will naturally be adjacent to their attackers.
        <br/>Ranged and magic units can still benefit, but they're much less likely to be next to enemy magic users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="wh">
        Witch Hunter's Bonus Attack
      </h2>
      <p>
        For the bonus attack to occur, one of the following conditions must be met:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You must be affected by the magic attack.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must have the same attacking type (melee / ranged / magic) as the unit directly targeted by magic.
          <br/>(This is always true if you are the directly-selected target.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Do note both effects may only happen up to 3 times / turn (once per turn if rank 1).
      </p>
      <div style="margin: 0 auto; width: 50%"><center><img src="images/scenario 1.png"/></center></div>
      <p>
        My pirate is casting Mojo Storm, directly targeting Old Scratch to hit two Bone Drakes, both of which have Witch Hunter 1.
        <br/><br/>
        Since Old Scratch attacks with magic, only magic-attacking enemies could counter with Witch Hunter.
        <br/>Thus, the Bone Drake next to my Pirate did not use Witch Hunter (it's a melee attacker).
        <br/>However, since it was next to my Pirate, it only took 50% damage.
      </p>

      <h2 class="wh">
        An interesting case with Witch Hunter.....
      </h2>
      <p>
        Something to note about how this Epic activates is that targeting out of range still uses one of the Epic's bonus attack(s).
        <br/>This wastes 1 fire from the user with Witch Hunter (even though the bonus attack wasn't used).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, here's a clip:
      </p>
      <center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYywb7E26_o" height="320" width="480"></iframe></center>
      <p>
        Before this turn, no Bone Drakes activated Witch Hunter.
        <br/><br/>
        Note that Witch Hunter did not activate against Old Scratch at all.
        <br/>This is because my Pirate hit them with Mojo Storm.
        <br/><br/>
        However, the Bone Drakes still took reduced damage from Scratch's spell, except for the one next to my Pirate (whose damage reduction was already used).
        <br/><br/><br/>
        Another example would be this scenario:
      </p>
      <center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HddEwWxrehg" height="320" width="480"></iframe></center>
      <p>
        A hidden unit attacked my Buccaneer with Hoodoo Touch, dealing 10 damage.
        <br/>Its stated base damage was 18, though, meaning that the attack was halved.
        <br/>(My Buccaneer has 0 Resistance.)
        <br/><br/>
        After that, another unit (not hidden) tried to use Ghostwail on my Buccaneer. However, he was attacked with Witch Hunter and was defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of these interactions, it's easier to state the bonus attack and damage reduction act independently of each other.
      </p>

      <h1 class="wh" id="res">
        How much Resistance does Witch Hunter 3+ give?
      </h1>
      <p>
        As I've stated in a different thread, the Resistance you gain from Witch Hunter 3:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          is equal to 25% of your total Spell Power, rounded down
          <br/>(Scratch greatly helps here with his Spell Power buffs!)
        </li>
        <li>
          lasts for 3 turns
        </li>
        <li>
          does not show up as a buff during turn selection
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can only gain Resistance from Witch Hunter 3+ when you successfully hit the enemy with it.
        Since it lasts for 3 turns, you can stack them to insane values, such as:
      </p>
      <center><img src="images/high Magic Resist.jpg"/></center>
      <p>
        Note how it says I gained 177 Resist <b>7 times</b>.
        <br/>This is the kind of Resist you can gain from Witch Hunter 3.
        <br/>(Witch Hunter hit seven times in the last 3 turns, hence the repetition.)
      </p>

      <center><img src="images/text divider.png"/></center>

      <h1 class="wh" id="base">
        How's Witch Hunter's base Damage determined?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's Witch Hunter's base Damage formula:
        <br/><br/><span style="margin-left: 15px">base = 1.35 * [Spell Power] * (1 + 0.002 * (main stat))</span>
        <br/><br/>
        As you can see, it uses Spell Power and the user's main stat (Strength / Agility / Will).
        <br/>Like other Epics, it may deal Physical or Magical Damage, depending on the weapon.
      </p>
      <center><img src="images/text divider.png"/></center>

      <h1 class="wh">
        Other Notes
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Images used for Witch Hunter 4 and 5 are edited by me.
          <br/>Witch Hunter 4 and 5 are not currently obtainable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="wh" id="sum">
        Summary
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Witch Hunter activates against incoming magic attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the user, Witch Hunter may deal a melee, ranged, or magic attack to the enemy.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can have up to 3 ranks of Witch Hunter via training it or using items that grant it (Phule's Wand + pet).
        </li>
        <li>
          Witch Hunter’s damage reduction and bonus attack work separately from each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          The damage reduction only works when adjacent to the enemy attacker.
          <br/>It works independent of the bonus attack the Epic grants.
        </li>
        <li>
          The bonus attack only occurs if you are affected and have the same attack type (melee / ranged / magic) as the directly-targeted unit (which can be yourself).
        </li>
        <li>
          Being affected by enemy magic will use the bonus attack's fires, regardless of whether the above condition is met.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resistance gained from Witch Hunter is based on the user's total Spell Power and lasts for 3 turns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Witch Hunter's base damage is based on the user's total Spell Power and main stat.
        </li>
      </ul>
