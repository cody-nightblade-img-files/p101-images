    <a href="https://www.pirate101central.com/" target="_blank">Pirate101Central</a>
    <br />Pirate101Central is the main Pirate101 fansite (and likely is the only active one remaining).
    <br />Here, you can find the Pirate101Central Wiki, as well as many posts, including various guides.

    <br />Thanks to Jester, the Pirate101Central wiki is back!
    <br />There are still some major issues with it that need fixing, but it's still pretty functional.
    <br />If you have questions about Companions, abilities, enemies, or drops, be sure to check this out!

    <br />Although I don't mind writing articles, it takes lots of time to do so.
    <br />That said, I have other things I would like to share, things I haven't shared on Pirate101Central yet.
    <br />This will take you to the folder where my planned posts are written.
    <br />You might find some useful information here, so why not check it out?

    <a href="https://discord.gg/bHvxZur" target="_blank">Senor_Spicy_'s Discord Server</a>
    <br />If you've Pirate101 questions to ask or want to play the game with others, then I recommend asking around in this Discord server!
    <br />There's a handful of active Pirate101 players here, and this would be my recommendation for a Pirate101 community to join.

    <a href="p101-ability-calculator.html">Pirate101 Base Damage / Healing Calculator</a> (currently a work-in-progress)
    <br />For a while, I've wanted to make a site for calculating base values.
    <br />This is what it currently looks like (currently not finished).
    <br />(I plan to update / finish this in the future.)
