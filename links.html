        Goes into general detail about how Movement works, and how to apply it in battle.
        <br />This guide is friendly and easy to understand, aside from the pyramids.
        <br />Although outdated, most of its concepts still apply to this day, both in PvE and PvP.
        <br />I do wish to make an updated version of this guide (scrapping the pyramids, mostly, as the rest of the article is digestible and important), but I do not do PvP.
